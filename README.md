## Features

### Functional Requirements
- **Ice Cream Size Selection**: 
  - Choose from Kids ($3.50), Single ($5.50), Double ($7.50), or Triple ($9.50).
  - Single size is selected by default.

  - Number of flavors depends on the size:
    - Kids/Single: 1 flavor (default: first).
    - Double: 2 flavors (default: first two).
    - Triple: 3 flavors (default: first three).
  - Users can select repeated flavors (e.g., all Vanilla for Triple).
- **Extras**:
  - Waffle cone/bowl ($1.50).
  - Toppings (chocolate, candy, fruit, nuts â€“ $0.50 each).
  - No extras are selected by default.

  - **Checkout**: Displays order subtotal, 5% tax, and total.
  - **New Order**: Resets the form for a new order.
  - **Exit**: Closes the application.

### Code Requirements

- Includes **colors and at least one image** to enhance the interface.
- Uses **constants** for values instead of hardcoding.
- Comments:
